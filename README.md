# 📱 React Native Development Setup with Expo

## 🎯 Objective

Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the **Expo Framework** for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

### Prerequisites

The following must be installed and ready:

- ✅ **Node.js LTS**
- ✅ **Visual Studio Code** (recommended IDE)
- ✅ **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- ✅ **Expo Go** on your physical device (Android or iOS)

These tools are essential for completing the upcoming projects efficiently.

## 📲 Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile development typically uses device emulators to test apps. However, supporting multiple device versions (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android models) can be costly in terms of hardware and setup time.

**Expo Go** provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native apps directly on your physical device—supporting both iOS and Android.
